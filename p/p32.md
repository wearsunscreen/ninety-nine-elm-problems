# Problem 32

Determine the greatest common divisor of two positive integer numbers. Use [Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) which recurses over the following steps:

1. Given two numbers, a and b divide a by b
2. If the remainder of the division is 0, the numerator is the gcd.
3. else divide the demoninator by the remainder and return to step 2.


## Example
```elm
gcd 36 63 = 9
```

## Unit Test
```
import Html
import List
import Maybe


gcd : Int -> Int -> Int
gcd a b =
    -- Your implementation goes here
    0


main =
    Html.text
        (if (test) then
            "Your implementation passed all tests."
         else
            "Your implementation failed at least one test."
        )


test : Bool
test =
    List.all (\( result, expect ) -> result == expect)
        [ ( gcd 36 63, 9 )
        , ( gcd 10 25, 5 )
        , ( gcd 120 120, 120 )
        , ( gcd 2 12, 2 )
        , ( gcd 23 37, 1 )
        , ( gcd 45 330, 15 )
        , ( gcd 24528 65934, 6 )
        , ( gcd 120 -120, 120 )
        , ( gcd -2 12, 2 )
        , ( gcd 37 23, 1 )
        ]
```
