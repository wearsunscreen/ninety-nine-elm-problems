# Problem 16

Drop every nth element from a list.

##Example
```
dropNth [1..10] 3 == [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10]
```

## Unit Test
```
import Html
import List


dropNth : List a -> Int -> List a
dropNth list n =
    -- your implementation goes here
    []


main : Html.Html a
main =
    Html.text
        <| case test of
            0 ->
                "Your implementation passed all tests."

            1 ->
                "Your implementation failed one test."

            x ->
                "Your implementation failed " ++ (toString x) ++ " tests."


test : Int
test =
    List.length
        <| List.filter ((==) False)
            [ dropNth [ 1, 2, 5, 5, 2, 1 ] 2 == [ 1, 5, 2 ]
            , dropNth [1..20] 3 == [ 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 ]
            , dropNth [1..5] 6 == [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
            , dropNth [1..5] 0 == [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
            , dropNth [1..5] -1 == [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
            , dropNth [1..5] 1 == []
            , dropNth [ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6" ] 2 == [ "1", "3", "5" ]
            ]

```

## Hints
1. This is why [Problem 20](p20.md) goes in front of Problem 16; add recursion, and more checking of your inputs.
