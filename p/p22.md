# Problem 22

Create a list containing all integers within a given range, inclusively, allow for reverse order

##Example
```elm
range 8 4 == [8, 7, 6, 5, 4]
```
## Unit Test
```elm
import Html 
import List


range : Int -> Int -> List Int 
range start end = 
    -- your implementation goes here
    []


main : Html.Html a
main =
    Html.text
        <| case test of
            0 ->
                "Your implementation passed all tests."

            1 ->
                "Your implementation failed one test."

            x ->
                "Your implementation failed " ++ (toString x) ++ " tests."


test : Int
test =
    List.length
        <| List.filter ((==) False)
            [ range 1 5 == [1..5]
            , range 0 5 == [0..5]
            , range -1 5 == [-1..5]
            , range 5 -1 == [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
            , range 5 5 == [ 5 ]
            , List.length (range 1 999) == 999
            ]
            
            
(..) : Int -> Int -> List Int
(..) start end =
    List.range start end
```

## Hints
1. Oh, I don't know, maybe recursion?
2. Range only varies from the range operator (..) by allowing reverse order.
