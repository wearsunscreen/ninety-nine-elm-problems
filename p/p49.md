# Problem 49
The [Gray Code](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GrayCode.html) is a binary numbering system used in error correction system. It can be generated for different bit sizes using a *reflecting* pattern. To generate a two-bit code, take the single bit Gray code 0, 1. Write it forwards, then backwards: 0, 1, 1, 0. Prepend 0s to the first half and 1s to the second half: 00, 01, 11, 10. To generate a 3-bit code, write 00, 01, 11, 10, 10, 11, 01, 00 to obtain: 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100.
##Example
```elm
grayCode 3 == [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,0], [1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,0,0]]
```
## Unit Test
```elm
import Html
import List
import Maybe
-- generate an array of integers encoded with Gray's binary code
grayCodes : Int -> List (List Int)
grayCodes numBits =
 let
 n = max 0 numBits
 in
 case n of
 0 ->
 []

 1 ->
 [[0], [1]]

 _ ->
 let
 n = abs numBits
 xs = grayCodes (n - 1)
 in
 (List.map ((::) 0) xs) ++ (List.map ((::) 1) (List.reverse xs))
main =
 Html.text
 (if (test) then
 "Your implementation passed all tests."
 else
 "Your implementation failed at least one test."
 )
test : Bool
test =
 List.all ((==) True)
 [ grayCodes 1 == [[0],[1]]
 , grayCodes 2 == [[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
 , grayCodes 3 == [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,0], [1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,0,0]]
 , grayCodes 4 == [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1], [0,0,1,1], [0,0,1,0], [0,1,1,0], [0,1,1,1], [0,1,0,1], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,0,0], [1,1,0,1], [1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,0], [1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,1], [1,0,0,1], [1,0,0,0]]
 , testGray 4 (grayCodes 4)
 , testGray 5 (grayCodes 5)
 , testGray 8 (grayCodes 8)
 , testGray 13 (grayCodes 13)
 ]


getDeltas : List (List Int) -> List Int
getDeltas xs =
 case xs of
 [] ->
 [0]

 [g1] ->
 [0]

 [g1, g2] ->
 [abs ((List.sum g1) - (List.sum g2))]

 g1 :: g2 :: gs ->
 abs ((List.sum g1) - (List.sum g2)) :: getDeltas (g2 :: gs)

-- In the Gray bit code the sum of the bits of two neighboring numbers
-- is always 1
testGray : Int -> List (List Int) -> Bool
testGray bits xs =
 let
 highest = Maybe.withDefault [-5]
 <| List.head
 <| List.reverse xs
 one = Maybe.withDefault [-5]
 <| List.head
 <| Maybe.withDefault [[-5]]
 <| List.tail xs
 zero = Maybe.withDefault [-5]
 <| List.head xs
 deltas = getDeltas xs
 in
 List.all ((==) True)
 [ List.sum highest == 1
 , List.sum one == 1
 , List.length xs == 2 ^ bits
 , List.sum zero == 0
 ]
 && List.all ((==) 1) deltas

```
## Hints
1. Use the reflecting nature of the Gray code to recursively solve for the answer.
2. The Gray code can also be generated using a fold, in Haskell this looks like:
gray :: Integral a => a -> [String]
gray 0 = [""]
gray n = foldr (\s acc -> ("0" ++ s):("1" ++ s):acc) [] $ gray (n-1)
