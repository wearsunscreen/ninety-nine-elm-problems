# Problem 70a

A multiway tree has a root element and a set of successors which are multiway trees themselves. A multiway tree is never empty, although it's list of children may be an empty list. 

* Define type to a represent multiway trees.
* Create a tree instance to represent the tree in the diagram below. 
* Write a function to count all nodes of the tree.

## Unit Test

```elm
import Html
import List


type MTree a = 
    -- your definition goes here 


mtree70 = 
    -- instantiate the multiway tree illutrated above 


count : MTree a -> Int
    -- your definition goes here
    
    
main =
    Html.text
        (if (test) then
            "Your implementation passed all tests."
         else
            "Your implementation failed at least one test."
        )


test : Bool
test =
    List.all ((==) True)
      [ count mtree70 == 7
      ]      
      
```
