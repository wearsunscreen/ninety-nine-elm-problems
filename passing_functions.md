# Passing functions as arguments

In many programming languages functions are first-class. This means that a function is a value that can be passed as a argument to other functions. Functions are as fundamental as integers, characters, booleans and  strings. The problems below demonstrate functions in the Elm core that take functions are arguments. Likewise, you will often create your own functions that take functions are arguments. 

##Functions that take functions

[Problem 28a](p/p28a.md) - Use ```List.sortBy``` to sort a list.

[Problem 31](p/p31.md) - Use ```List.filter``` to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

[Problem 34](p/p34.md) - Use ```List.filter``` to implement Euler's totient function.
