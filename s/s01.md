# Problem 1 Solutions

##Solution 1
Recursive search for the last element

```
last : List a -> Maybe a
last xs = 
  case xs of
    [ ] -> Nothing
    [a] -> Just a
    y::ys -> last ys
```
##Solution 2
Reverse and take the head.
```
last : List a -> Maybe a
last xs = 
   List.reverse xs |> List.head
```

##Solution 3
[Point-free style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming), reverse and take the head.
```
last : List a -> Maybe a
last = 
   List.reverse >> List.head
```

##Solution 4
Use `List.foldl`.
```elm
last : List a -> Maybe a
last list =
    case list of
        [] ->
            Nothing
            
        x::xs ->
            Just (List.foldl (\a b -> a) x list)
```
